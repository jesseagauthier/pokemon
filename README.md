I decided to integrate the main theme of Pokemon into my design. "Catch 'em all" was the inspiration for my layout. The user will be able to swipe to switch between each Pokemon. They will have the ability to catch any Pokemon, access the caught Pokemon, and release them if they reach the maximum number of caught Pokemon.

Part 3: 
While working on my Pokémon app, I had some problems keeping the Pokémon cards consistent. The main issue was that each Pokémon image had a different size, making it tricky to make them all look good when resizing them.
Another challenge I faced was placing the Pokéball in the right spot on each card to maintain a consistent look.
To fix the image size problem, I found a way to make all the Pokémon images the same size by resizing and cropping them while keeping their shape intact. This helped give the cards a nice and polished appearance.
