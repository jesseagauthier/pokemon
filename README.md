I decided to integrate the main theme of Pokemon into my design. "Catch 'em all" was the inspiration for my layout. The user will be able to swipe to switch between each Pokemon. They will have the ability to catch any Pokemon, access the caught Pokemon, and release them if they reach the maximum number of caught Pokemon.
